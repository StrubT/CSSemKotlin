# CSSemKotlin
This repository contains the example application written as part of the presentation #21 'Kotlin'
in the course Computer Science Seminar (BTI7311) at the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BUAS) in the autumn term 2015/16.

The [documentation](doc/documentation.pdf) gives a brief introduction to the Kotlin programming language.

The main project consists of three dependent modules:
* API: `api-kotlin`
* JPA Implementation : `jpa-kotlin`
* JavaFX Application: `app-kotlin`

A fourth module is independent and uses a different technology:
* JavaScript Library: `js-kotlin`

No Kotlin script module has been created yet.
